# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Purpose
This web page helps users to generate password randomly. I was able to use basic JavaScript skills to build this site. I had issues in looping password length if the length failed to meet the requirments, as well as creating a selection of at least one character. In the end, I learned to use the while loop to meet my needs. New skill!
